GRAMMA: Sorrel! Come see!
SORREL: What is it, Gramma? Are you alright?
GRAMMA: Oh I’m more than alright...This is the best I’ve felt in years. Come, look at the soil...look closely!
SORREL: There are saplings growings here...they’re small, but they’re growing.
GRAMMA: Yes, yes! It’s incredible...I have no idea how they got here…
SORREL: A miracle, I guess.
GRAMMA: No...not a miracle. 
SORREL: No?
GRAMMA: A hero.
SORREL: Haha! 
GRAMMA: You can laugh, Sorrel, but the person responsible for this is a hero to me, to all of us. 
SORREL: Maybe you could call them that. They sound more like a rebel to me…
GRAMMA: Rebels can be heroes. This one certainly is. Whoever she is, she must be very brave and kind, to do this for the people. Not to mention, fast and agile!
SORREL: ...She? Do you know this hero, Gramma?
GRAMMA: Call it a feeling.
SORREL: Hmmm...I guess she’s not that sneaky then, is she?
GRAMMA: Nothing gets past these old eyes. It’s our secret, Sorrel. 
SORREL: Thank you, Gramma. 
GRAMMA: No dear, thank you.
