SORREL: Gramma, how are you feeling? Your breathing sounds...off. 
GRAMMA: I’m just fine, Sorrel. You worry too much about your old Gran. 
SORREL: It sounds like it hurts...
GRAMMA: Don’t worry, dear. These old lungs are just tired. 
SORREL: The air is so thin here, there’s no plant growth, no oxygen. That can’t help! 
GRAMMA: No...it certainly doesn’t. But there’s nothing to be done about that, dear. I don’t think we can afford a personal oxygenation device, not now. 
SORREL: They just hiked the price. Again. Bastards…
GRAMMA: Language!
SORREL: Sorry Gramma. I’m just frustrated is all. 
GRAMMA: I know, I know.
SORREL: …
GRAMMA: You’ve got that look in your eye, Sorrel. What are you thinking?
SORREL: It’s nothing…
GRAMMA: Sorrel...I know that look. 
SORREL: It’s just–! You deserve a garden, Gramma! You deserve to breathe! We have a right to live!
GRAMMA: Sorrel, dear...I understand your anger. But there’s nothing we can do. The flora belongs to them. 
SORREL: That’s not right! The earth belongs to all of us!
GRAMMA: It’s always been like this, Sorrel. As long as I can remember. I don’t think it will change.
SORREL: Not if I can help it…
